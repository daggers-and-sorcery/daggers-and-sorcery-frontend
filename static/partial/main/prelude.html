                You are one of these explorers. After leaving your home and having no further prospects, you decide to
                join
                this bold quest. With high hopes, you sign your life away on an official document and are ushered aboard
                the
                Paloma. Suddenly, you’re surrounded by seasoned explorers and warriors with grand stories of their past
                exploits. There are humans, dwarves, elves, dark elves, and the occasional gnome, and you have never
                seen
                such a diverse crowd in your entire life. Before you can change your mind, the port is shrinking into
                the
                distance.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once the ship is on course, Captain Lombardi, the leader of the expedition, introduces himself with a
                booming
                voice and states the rules for the voyage. Most of his rules were described in your contract, and any
                offender to these rules will walk the plank. After he finishes his speech, the captain returns to the
                stern
                where he begins speaking with his first mate. You see them holding a gigantic map, and you yearn for a
                map
                of your own, wishing you knew the whereabouts of your destination.
            </p>

            <p>
                While pondering the next chapter of your life, you lean against the ship’s railing and watch the other
                explorers. You wonder about each of their pasts and from which countries they hailed from. A few of the
                explorers must be already acquainted since they were either huddling in groups or keeping their distance
                with solemn expressions. At the moment, nobody seems particularly interested in you, and you feel like
                that
                is a good thing.
            </p>

            <p>
                As sunset approaches, the tensions have lowered, and the explorers have settled down with the crew
                members
                to
                have supper. The elves, all seven of them, entertained the company with a charming story about their
                midsummer festivals. They detail how midsummer is an essential holiday in their culture and how they
                felt
                shameful for missing the celebration of the summer solstice, the longest day of the year. To the elves,
                this
                tradition appeased nature and would bring plentiful harvest and prosperity, and they propose having
                their
                own festival aboard the ship. That’s when the merrymaking begins.
            </p>

            <p>
                The elves remove lutes and ocarinas and play elvish ballads while the crew clap their hands and stomp
                the
                feet. Meanwhile, you try to eat your supper in relative peace until the elves remove colorful ribbons
                and
                transform the mast into a maypole. Before you know it, a female elf hands you a teal ribbon and urges
                you to
                celebrate with the others. The only person opposed to the festivities is Captain Lombardi, but even his
                boisterous laugh echoes over the ship by nightfall. You suspect the seemingly endless kegs of ale from
                the
                Paloma’s lower levels.
            </p>

            <p>
                When you wake in the morning, everything is silent. You walk to the upper decks and study the remains of
                the
                previous night. A few of the colorful ribbons are still wrapped around the mast, but the majority of
                them
                are strewn across the deck. The first mate orders you to clean up the mess, and you oblige. You were one
                of
                the few who had not been drinking ale or wine last night, so at the moment, it was the least you could
                do.
                As you reach down to collect a purple ribbon, you stumble as a massive wave slams against the Paloma.
            </p>

            <p>
                An icy wind billows out of nowhere, and large thunderclouds appear in the distance, roiling toward the
                ship
                like a starved beast. The gusts rip the ribbon from your grasp and carry it far away. The grey sky
                transforms before your eyes, turning as dark as pitch, and you stare upward as the clouds release their
                burden. Torrential rain pours from above, and you’re swept off your feet by a wave and are nearly dumped
                overboard. You cling to the railing as the ship comes alive. The crew members scatter to their stations,
                trying to navigate the Paloma through the harsh storm. A sharp whistling sound fills the air, and you
                hear
                malevolent whispers on the wind. As the first bolt of lightning cracks, you’re temporarily blinded by
                the
                sudden light, but you can just barely see a host of wispy phantoms surrounding the ship. None of your
                company seem to notice these creatures, and before you can warn them, you hear a shuddering crack.
            </p>

            <p>
                A massive hole appears on the vessel’s starboard side, allowing seawater to flood inward. With each
                passing
                moment, the ship sinks lower to its watery demise. You make a rash decision and leap overboard. Luckily,
                there are pieces of driftwood to keep you afloat, and you paddle far away from the sinking ship. Before
                you
                can swim more than a few yards, a vortex appears around the ship and sucks it beneath the surface. You
                cling
                to the piece of driftwood for dear life as water crashes over your head, submerging you again and again
                until you fall unconscious. Before the storm disappears, it washes you onto a sandy shore.
            </p>

            <p>
                Your head feels fuzzy. Blinking your eyes open, you see a fire radiating from a stone hearth. You are
                tucked beneath warm quilts and feel quite sleepy. Swords and assorted tools mount the walls. You hear a
                door creak open, and a bearded man enters the room.
            </p>

            <p>"You're awake!"</p>

            <p>"Where am I?" you ask, clearing your throat.</p>

            <p>The strange man offers you a cup of water which you greatly accept.</p>

            <p>
                "This is my home." The man gestures around him. "I was a delivering a broadsword to Guirag, and on my
                way back, I found you washed up on the shore. You must have been caught in that evil storm. I tried to
                wake you, but you were in a deep sleep. I brought you back with me. We're in Sevgard now. You're safe."

                After calming down a bit, you fall asleep again. Maybe because of exhaustion, and maybe because of your
                savior´s soothing words, your mind wanders and you dream. You dream of forests. Lush, beautiful forest
                untouched by human hand. You walk around in wonder, donning your usual:

                You feel surge of killing intent from behind. You leap forward, only to feel claws of beast graze your
                back. Fortunately you were fast enough. Meanwhile, scenery around you changes. Trees wither, Flowers and
                leaves are decaying rapidly. Where you sensed serenity and beauty, ther is only death and emptiness now.
                You sense evil presence all around you. You wake up covered in sweat.

                That dream, you feel something odd about it. It felt too real, killing intent was terrifying, you could

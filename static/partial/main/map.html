                                    Farmfields is a large, fertile vale nestled outside Sevgard's stone walls. Sevgard
                                    operates under a form of feudalism and provides farmers with land, supplies, and
                                    protection in exchange for fresh produce and meat. This relationship has thrived for
                                    centuries and has allowed Sevgard to become a prosperous city.

                                    On its own, Farmfields is a quaint, cooperative community. The fields are divided
                                    into
                                    plots with sturdy fences built around them, and each plot contains a different crop,
                                    guarded by a stout scarecrow. For every few plots, there is a green pasture for
                                    cattle,
                                    horses, goats, and sheep to graze. Their manure is then used to fertilize the fields
                                    which gives the land a natural, earthy scent. One central irrigation system supplies
                                    the
                                    fields from the Hister River and its tributaries. The Hister flows strong throughout
                                    the
                                    year and keeps the crops refreshed during the warm season. What is more, an inn was
                                    established to accommodate travelers, and it is stationed beside the farmers' market
                                    where business is conducted.

                                    From sunrise to sunset, the farmers can be found in their fields plowing, seeding,
                                    weeding, or harvesting. There is always work to be done. With their ever expanding
                                    fields, they require extra farmhands and will offer their hospitality for a hard
                                    day's
                                    work. Wheat is the predominant crop, and when the wind blows, the wheat sways like a
                                    tumultuous wave. As a result, the locals nicknamed the fields the Golden Sea. It is
                                    an
                                    especially breathtaking sight when the sun is setting, and the fields seem to glow
                                    in
                                    the dying light.

                                    By nightfall, lanterns are lit on posts to prevent weary travelers from drifting
                                    astray.
                                    Despite Sevgard's age old vow to protect its farmers, the guards have become lax in
                                    their patrols. More bandits, goblins, and orcs have been roaming the countryside
                                    after
                                    dark.

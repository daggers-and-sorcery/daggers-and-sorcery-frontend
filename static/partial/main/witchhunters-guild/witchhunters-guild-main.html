                <div class="description-holder" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" hm-read-more hm-limit="300" hm-text="From behind the counter of the abandoned shop, you find the hidden door and descend into darkness. You progress forward through a small, narrow stone corridor. At the end is a door, which you opened eagerly. Behind it was the guarded entrance of the Witchhunter's Guild. To your left and right are hand picked, brutish looking men with both light and heavy weaponry. They only let you pass after you mention yourself to be &quot;a friend of Yip's&quot;. Welcome back to the Guild's Hall. <br><br> Various hunters examine some weapons on the nearby wall. Axes, swords, crossbows, staffs for mages and maces are among the many tools of the trade. All hand crafted and designed for the explicit purpose of fighting otherworldly monsters. These creations were vicious in design, each one had been used many times - as they all smelled strongly of blood. To imagine the amount of evil flesh they have rendered brought an eerie thought to your mind. What makes these guild-brothers so resilient and hardy? Was it their weapons or was it the mentality that allowed them to wield such tools? One thing was sure, they had complete control of their destinies and there was something admirable about those who so wished to risk their life in the defense of others. <br><br> The hall was in no way very large, nor was it very small. It was just right, hidden beneath the streets above and kept well warmed by the small fireplaces and firepits scattered through out the areas. Various tables which contained food and drink were strategically placed in front of little kiosks who offered their services and specialties. One hut in particular offered books of knowledge, another small weapons to be thrown and of course, another shop exclusively allowed for the purchase of dark, blackened leather garments that were basically a trademark to the Guild. Hunters moved all around you, it was a living economy of people with an individually driven economy."></div>
